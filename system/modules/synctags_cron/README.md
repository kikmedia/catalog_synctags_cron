Contao Catalog SyncTagsCron
===========================

About

Automatically sync tags against an imported Contao Catalog.

Feel free on submitting tickets and feature requests.

System requirements

* Contao CMS Version 2.9 up to 2.11
* Contao Catalog extension
* optional: Contao Cron extension

Usage

Simply call /system/modules/synctags_cron/synctags.php via cronjob, so all your tags will be synced against all your catalogs. This is equivalent to Catalog maintenance via Catalog backend menu but will work automatically.
